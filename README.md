# How to Program From The Ground Up (with Minimal BS)
¬©2024 Chris Athanas

A follow-along guide for anyone who wants a solid understanding of software development as a semi-historical
walk through the essential parts of computing leading to present day software development paradigms.

This is not a thorough deep dive into any one topic, but a broad overview of the core concepts and principles
that are missing from most programming tutorials and courses. My goal is to give you the context about
why things are the way they are in computing, and how they came to be that way, and the issues and problems that
arose from things being that way.

I have found that it's far more important to understand the process that people went through to create the
current solutions than to understand the mechanical details of how the solutions work. Many details about
the disadvantages and limitations are often left out when teaching these techniques, or worse, simply not known or dismissed as
irrelevant due to ignorance.

## Introduction
  - This is a "how-to" guide for anyone interested in creating software who needs an overview of techniques and concepts 
    used, from the fundamentals of physical logic representation to high-level programming languages and 
    the "`how`" and "`why`" of the various paradigms and methodologies used in software development.
  
  - ### My Goal is to Have You:
    - Understand more the `why` and `how` of programming, not just the `what` and mechanical explanations.
      - This is my curated list of information to take you on a realistic and grounded journey of understanding
        the essential part of computing to create effective software.
      - There will be some technical details, but only enough to understand the fundamental principles, not to be an expert.
      - I cover the areas that I had difficulty understanding when I was learning to program.
      - This is more-or-less a historical walk through `WHY` things are the way they are in computing, and `HOW` they came to be that way.
  
      > I have since discovered that the majority of my confusion derived from how things were presented to me. 
      > Instructors often completely misunderstood correct application and limits of metaphors and lacked real-world 
      > experience of the things they were teaching. Many just repeated what they were taught without understanding.
      > When challenged about their knowledge, they would often become defensive and dismissive, and sometimes even hostile.
        
      > Many of the concepts are, in retrospect, full of needless jargon and unnecessary complexity. I now understand that
      > the complexity was often used to make the instructor seem more knowledgeable and to make the subject seem more
      > difficult than it actually is.
          
      > I would like to say at the outset that there is a TREMENDOUS number of technical-sounding words with all
      > referring to the same basic core ideas. I will do my best to be as consistent as possible, and also work to 
      > point out the multiple definitions and reduce the jargon and clarify the core meanings and ideas.

## The Essence of Computing
  - People used to do all computing by hand, and now we use various machines to do the same thing, 
    in a much faster and more reliable way.
    - When we use a machine to do computing, we are just using the machine to represent the problem and the 
      solution in a different way.
    - The machine knows nothing about the problem. it's only following orders created by clever humans using 
      boolean logic to represent the problem and its sequence of actions to solve it.
    - Each operation in the computer was once done by teams of people working in groups, logically delineated in 
      nearly the same way as the computer's components are arranged.
        - There were specialized roles for each person, for example, the "storage" would be a set of filing cabinets 
          and a clerk to store and retrieve them.
          - This is now done by the "hard drive" and the "file system" in the computer.
        - The arithmetic would be done by a person called a "calculator" who would perform the operations and record the results.
          - This is now done by the "Arithmetic Logic Unit" and stored in the "Registers" in the computer.

  ## SOME IMPORTANT ITEMS TO KEEP IN MIND
  - THERE IS NO MAGIC IN COMPUTING, ONLY _HUMAN_ CLEVERNESS, _HUMAN_ SYSTEMIC THINKING AND _HUMAN_ INGENUITY 
    USED TO SOLVE _HUMAN_ PROBLEMS. 
    - If you hear anyone say _"it's magic"_ or _"it's a black box"_ or _"it's kind of like a person,"_ 
      they are: 
      1) Being lazy, 
      2) Or indicating it's not relevant at the moment,
      3) Or (USUALLY) they don't understand the problem or the solution enough to explain it and become hand-wavy.
  
  - ## ITS ALWAYS JUST _HUMAN_ CLEVERNESS AND INGENUITY, THE IDEA OF REPRESENTING ONE THING AS ANOTHER, NOTHING MORE.
      
     - The machines CAN _NEVER_ UNDERSTAND the problem or the solution in the way humans conceive of the problem.
     - These machines are only following the logical operations that humans have carefully designed to represent 
       the problem and a solution "space." There is no inherent "understanding" in the machine, and can never be.
     - The only way the machine would ever know the full human context of the problem (and the solution) is if 
       the machine ACTUALLY was a human, and then it would be a _human_, and not a machine. 
     - Mistaking the machine for having intelligence is known as "The Eliza Effect" and is a common mistake 
       made by people who don't understand the limits of the machine's capabilities.
