# Conclusion

## Programming Paradigms are Just Different Styles to Structure and Organize Software
###### paradigms
  - The different paradigms are not better or worse than each other, they are just different styles to structure the
    state and behavior of software to provide a solution.
  - Paradigms are not independent, Different paradigms can be combined to create a program that is easier to understand and maintain.
  - Paradigms are not frozen and are constantly evolving as new ideas are added to the software development
    methods to make creating software easier and more effective.
  - Each paradigm has its own benefits, costs, and trade-offs that must be considered when
    choosing which paradigm is appropriate for a particular problem. 
    ### <font style="color: yellow;"> Often, the best solution is the simplest one.</font>
  - Paradigms are not dogma, and should not be followed blindly, but should be used as a guide to help
    structure and organization the program to be easiest to understand and change.
 
## You Can Only Learn Programming By Actually Programming
###### learning_programming
  - The best way to learn programming that I've found is to physically copy (actual typing) other programs and change them. 
  - ### You can read all the books and watch all the videos you want, but you will not learn programming until you actually start solving problems, and seeing how other people solve them is a great start.
  - ## IT IS **_VERY IMPORTANT_**  THAT YOU TRY TO CHANGE THE CODE AFTER YOU HAVE COPIED IT. _THIS IS CRITICAL._
  - Doing "code katas" and "coding challenges" are a great way to practice programming and learn new programming
    languages and paradigms.
  - But after you know the mechanics, the bigger challenge is to learn how to structure and organize the state and
    behavior of the software to be easiest to understand and change.
  - This is a life-long learning process, and how to arrange ideas and concepts to make them easier to understand
    and change is a skill that takes time and practice to develop, and only comes with experience and some luck.

    > ### BEWARE THE PROGRAMMING TUTORIAL TAR-PITS
    > - Always code-along with the tutorial, and change it afterward to make sure you understand.
    > - Learn how to save your projects to GitHub, it's not hard, and you will be able to track your progress.
    > >  ### <span style="color: red; ">If you ONLY just watch, it <span style="font-weight: bold;"> WILL BE A COMPLETE </span> waste of time, even though you _**THINK**_ you understand it. </span>

# <font color="red"> QUIT LOOKING FOR SHORT-CUTS </font>
###### short-cuts
  - The biggest problem I've seen with people trying to learn programming is that they are looking for a short-cut.
  - QUIT IT AND GET IN THERE AND START TYPING AND CHANGING CODE.
  - All developers must pay the same price to learn programming, and that price is time and effort.

## Programming Will Always Be a Human Activity - AI Cannot Possibly Solve Everything and Requires Human Guidance
###### programming-is-human
  - Solution methods will become a bit more abstract in the future using tools like GitHub copilot, but the
    programmer will still need to know all these details to get the machine to do EXACTLY what they want it to do.
  - We are always going to need people who have various tastes and understandings about humans and the world to
    create software that is useful and effective FOR THOSE PARTICULAR HUMANS.

## My Favorite Book on Learning Kotlin
  - ### <span style="color: yellow; ">  I prefer learning how to program a new language using a book. They are usually much more thought out than videos. It also forces you to read and write. Physical copies are the preferred mode, as you can write notes on the pages, and IT IS TOTALLY OK AND RECOMMENDED THAT YOU DO THAT. </span>
